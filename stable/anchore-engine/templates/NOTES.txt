To use Anchore you need the URL, username, and password to access the API and/or the UI.
Anchore can be accessed via port {{ .Values.anchoreApi.service.port }} on the following DNS name from within the cluster:

    {{ template "anchore-engine.api.serviceName" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local

* NOTE: On first startup of Anchore, the policy-engine performs a CVE data sync which may take several minutes to complete.
During this time the system status will report 'partially_down' and any images added for analysis will stay in the 'not_analyzed' state.
Once the sync is complete, any queued images will be analyzed and the system status will change to 'all_up'.

Initial setup time can be >120sec for postgresql setup and readiness checks to pass for the services as indicated by pod state.
You can check with:

    kubectl get pods -l app={{ template "anchore-engine.fullname" .}},component=api

{{- if and .Release.IsUpgrade (regexMatch "1.22.[0-9]+" .Chart.Version) }}
{{- $apiDeployment := (lookup "apps/v1" "Deployment" .Release.Namespace (include "anchore-engine.api.fullname" .)) }}
{{- if not $apiDeployment }}

**WARNING**
